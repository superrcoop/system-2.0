`Department of Computing Lab System 2.0 beta` 
===============================================

Description
-----------

`Department of Computing Lab System 2.0 beta` is a system that was built to as part of a school project given by the User Interface Lecturer at the University of the West Indies. The project is currently in developer mode and is projected to be completed by the end of this month with the hopes of being deployed to be used by the Coomputer Science Lab at the University of the West Indies.

With the help of Electron, creating the desktop application became very easy as it allowed the use of pure 'JavaScript HTML & CSS' to design and develop.


**Why ?**

The current system that is being used by the lab assistants is very limited and ugly. After I got the assignment, I thought it would be cool (as a lab assistant myself) to take it up on my self to do some research on how to make the tool more useful and more beautiful. After long hours of research and collection of data from the other lab assistants and lab managers, I thought about new functionalities and a brand new design for the system.
